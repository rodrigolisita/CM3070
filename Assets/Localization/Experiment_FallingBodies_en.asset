      module, we explore one of the most fundamental questions in physics: What happens
      when objects fall?'

    m_Localized: "Centuries ago, Aristotle believed that heavier objects fall faster
      than lighter ones. His ideas shaped science for nearly 2,000 years\u2014until
      Galileo Galilei challenged them. Through bold experiments, Galileo discovered
      that\u2014without air resistance\u2014all objects fall at the same rate, regardless
      of their mass."

    m_Localized: Gravity, the force that pulls objects toward Earth. Drag, the resistance
      caused by air as objects move through it. And Buoyancy, the upward force exerted
      by fluids that can counteract gravity.

    m_Localized: "By experimenting with different shapes, materials, and environments,
      you\u2019ll see how these forces combine to influence motion\u2014and why a
      feather falls differently from a hammer."
