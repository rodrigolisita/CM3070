      In this module, you will:

      Investigate
      how gravity affects falling objects of different masses.

      Observe how
      air resistance (drag) alters motion based on shape and speed.

      Explore
      buoyancy in fluid environments and its impact on descent.

      Compare motion
      across different conditions to understand the interplay of forces.

      Apply
      scientific reasoning to predict, test, and explain outcomes.'
