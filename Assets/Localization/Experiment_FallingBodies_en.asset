    m_Localized: Ever wonder why a steel ship floats, but a small pebble sinks? It
      all comes down to a balance of forces, and in this lab, you'll get to see those
      forces in action.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4433566245879808
    m_Localized: 'We''ll focus on three main players: Gravity, the constant downward
      pull; Buoyancy, the upward push from the fluid; and Drag, the force that fights
      against motion.'

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4433593190088704
    m_Localized: Use the controls to adjust the object's properties and the surrounding
      fluid. Your goal is to discover the relationship between these parameters and
      the forces they generate.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673666024243200
    m_Localized: Let's look at Gravity. This is the fundamental force that pulls
      any two objects with mass toward each other. In this lab, it's the planet's
      immense gravity that constantly pulls the sphere downwards.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673670436651008
    m_Localized: The strength of this gravitational pull is directly proportional
      to the object's mass. As you use the slider to add more mass, you'll see the
      force of gravity increase. More mass equals a stronger pull.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673672852570112
    m_Localized: 'Now, here''s a question to explore: if you make the sphere larger
      but keep its mass exactly the same, does the force of gravity acting on it
      change? Use the controls to find out.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673675172020224
    m_Localized: Now for Buoyancy. This is the upward force that a fluid exerts on
      any object immersed in it. It's the force that opposes gravity and is the reason
      why things float.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673677046874112
    m_Localized: 'The strength of this buoyant force is determined by two things:
      the volume of the object submerged, and the density of the surrounding fluid.
      A larger object displaces more fluid, creating a stronger upward push.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673678993031168
    m_Localized: 'Here is your next challenge: can you make the sphere float? Try
      to find a combination of size, mass, and fluid that makes the buoyant force
      greater than the force of gravity.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673683694845952
    m_Localized: Finally, let's look at Drag. This is a frictional force that acts
      on any object moving through a fluid. Crucially, it always acts in the opposite
      direction of the object's motion, working to slow it down.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673685196406784
    m_Localized: Drag is complex and depends on several factors. It increases with
      the fluid's density, the object's cross-sectional area, and most importantly,
      with the square of the object's velocity. A faster object experiences dramatically
      more drag.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4673687046094848
    m_Localized: As an object falls and speeds up, its drag force grows until it
      perfectly balances the net force of gravity and buoyancy. At this point, the
      object stops accelerating and reaches a constant speed called 'Terminal Velocity'.
      Can you find the conditions that create the highest possible terminal velocity?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4701151369658368
    m_Localized: Not quite, but that's a common misconception. While the sphere's
      size and volume changed, its mass stayed the same. The force of gravity is
      determined by an object's mass, not its size. Notice on the display that the
      gravity value didn't change when you adjusted the diameter.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4701191190380544
    m_Localized: That's exactly right! The force of gravity depends only on an object's
      mass and the gravitational pull of the planet. Since the mass didn't change,
      the force of gravity remains the same, no matter how large or small the sphere
      gets.
